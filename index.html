    <h2>Words from Clients</h2>
    <div class="testimonial">
      “Dilpreet impressed me in many ways: she provided professional and clear communication with a sweet disposition; she delivered a perfect full foils service confidently: and she displayed keen attention to detail for my haircut. I really loved how she already has the hands and approach of a seasoned instructor when doing the full foils service.

I have attended McCollege for over ten years now and experienced a wide variety of students at varying levels of knowledge and practice. Dilpreet stands out in that she firmly and precisely applies and paints the foils without any second guessing. She goes quite close to the root and gets the job done in a quick fashion. She spent her time performing a really good service with minimal distraction or chatting when it counted. She focused on doing a good service first and did not sacrifice her focus with additional idle client rapport. When there was a break or rest period, such as when my hair was processing, she would chat a bit more and keep the enjoyable appointment moving forward.

I dare say, Dilpreet could possibly become an instructor at McCollege as she progresses through her career. Dilpreet has the gift of delivering what she learns in quick fashion. Yes, she is a new student, and yet she already shows amazing potential.

Thanks to all the instructors as well for checking in and providing guidance, to both of us, when needed.
